ROM:
Merged AOSP tag r52 (AKA Jun SPL, QPR3)
Moved from gmscompat to microg. This has many pros and cons, including:
 - google login may no longer work in some apps
 - safetynet now fully can pass
 - location is improved, mozilla is used for assisted location
 - in app purchases and play store no longer supported (can use aurora store)
Open microg and login to google account again + enable options if previously logged in on gmscompat
Reverted any kind of special runtime permissions
- That includes custom storage scopes, internet, sensors etc
Few other perf improvements and fixes
Add a schedule option for extra dim
- Similar to what we have for AOD
Other very minor changes
Merged r43 (aka May SPL)
